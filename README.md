# Chinese-text-formatter
Plugin for formatting Chinese text according to modern standards in ONLYOFFICE Editors

This project involves building a plugin for ONLYOFFICE that automatically formats Chinese text according to modern writing standards. It will adjust punctuation style, spacing between Chinese and Latin characters, full-width/half-width symbol usage, and more. The plugin may use open-source tools such as zhlint or zh. This tool will help users produce clean, standardized, and professional Chinese content effortlessly.
